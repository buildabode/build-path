## City water

If the neighbors are on city water, you likely will be too. 

The parcel must have a "Will Serve" letter from the water district that will provide the property with water. 
Here's an example [Will Serve Letter Request](https://www.svwd.org/sites/default/files/images/Will%20Serve%20Letter%20Request_2.pdf) for Scotts Valley. Contact your municipal water district to obtain yours.
